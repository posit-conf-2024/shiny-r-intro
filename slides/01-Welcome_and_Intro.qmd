## Other communication (Discord)

You should have received an email with an invitation and instructions for joining the conference's discord server.

This workshop has a private channel under Workshops,

::: {.large style="text-align: center"}
#workshop-shiny-r-intro
:::

This is a great place to ask questions, post resources, memes, or most anything else before, during, and after the workshop.



# Computational Environment

## RStudio Cloud

You can use the following link to join the workshops RStudio cloud space,

::: {.large .center}
[bit.ly/conf24-shiny-r-intro](https://bit.ly/conf24-shiny-r-intro)
:::

<p/>
<p/>

Once you have joined you can then select the `get-started-shiny` assignment, 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width='10%'}

:::

::: {.column width='80%' .center}
![](images/cloud_assignment.png)
:::
::::


which should then create a copy of all materials and launch a cloud session for you.


## Cloud session

If everything is working you should see something very close to the following,

![](images/cloud_session.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}


## File organization

::: {.extra-padding}

* `slides/` - all slides and related materials

* `demos/` - sample code for each demo

* `exercises/` -  starter code for each exercise

* `exercises/solutions/` - sample solution code for each exercise 

* `exercises/live/` - sample solution code we generate during the workshop, 
pushed at the end of each session

* `data/` - example data sets used in demos and exercises

# Introducing Shiny

## Shiny

::: center
![](images/shiny.png){width=25%}
:::

> Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.

## App Components

```{r shiny-anatomy}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|7|3|5"
library(shiny)

ui = list()

server = function(input, output, session) {}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

## Weather data

We need some data that we will be able to interact with for our Shiny apps today.

I've taken the liberty of collecting and preparing some historical weather data from [Meteostat](https://www.meteostat.net/) for some airports around the US.

```{r}
#| include: false
options(pillar.print_min = 7, pillar.print_max = 7)
```

```{r}
#| message: false
readr::read_csv(here::here("data/weather.csv"))
```


::: aside
See [here](https://posit-conf-2024.github.io/shiny-r-intro/data/) for a full data dictionary and [source code](https://github.com/posit-conf-2024/shiny-r-intro/blob/main/data/raw_weather.R) for collecting these data.
:::



## Demo 01 - Our first app

::: {.code-file .sourceCode .cell-code}
`r fontawesome::fa("file")` `demos/demo01.R`
:::
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "|6-26|10-20|23|28-36|38"
#| file: "../demos/demo01.R"
```


## Your turn - Exercise 01

Open `exercises/ex01.R` in Posit cloud and execute it via the Run App button in RStudio.

Check that you are able successfully run the shiny app and are able to interact with it by picking a new airport. 

* If everything is working try modifying the code, e.g. try adding or removing a city from `radioButtons()`.

* What happens if you add a city that is not in the `weather.csv` data set to the radio button input?

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(5)
```


## Troubleshooting

A couple of quick tips:

- If the app can't find the data, make sure you have opened the workshop's RStudio project

- If you are not using Posit cloud make sure you have the latest versions of `shiny` and `tidyverse` installed

- If you are stuck, ask a neighbor for help and/or raise your hand and myself or a TA will come by


# UIs

## Sidebar layout

<br/>

From [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/action-layout.html#page-with-sidebar)
:::

## UI functions are HTML

One of the neat tricks of Shiny is that the interface is just a web page, and this can be seen by the fact that UI functions are just R functions that generate HTML. 

We can run any of the following in our console and see the HTML output generated:

```{r eval=FALSE}
fluidPage()
sidebarLayout(sidebarPanel(),mainPanel())
radioButtons("test", "Test", choices = c("A","B","C"))
```

## Multi-row layout

## Your turn - Exercise 02

We've just seen a number of alternative input widgets, starting from the code in `exercises/ex02.R` try changing the `radioButton()` input to something else.

What happens if you use an input capable of selecting multiple values, e.g.

* `checkboxGroupInput()` 

* or `selectInput()` with `multiple = TRUE`


```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown::countdown(10)
```
